# Platform Engineering Workshop — Helm Charts

Helm charts that deploy a complete OpenShift Advanced Application Platform Demo environment on OpenShift 4.x. Designed for use with [this Ansible-based deployer](https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/etx-ansible-roles-agd), which bootstraps the cluster and deploys a single Argo CD `Application` CR pointing to the `app-of-apps/` chart. From there, Argo CD manages everything.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **workshop/demo environment**. Some design choices (storing passwords in Vault at deploy time, broad RBAC grants, shared credentials) reflect that priority. Don't use this as a production reference architecture.

## What gets deployed

The workshop stands up the following on a single OpenShift cluster:

| Component | Chart | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **HashiCorp Vault** | `vault/` | Secrets backend — stores tokens, passwords, and credentials |
| **External Secrets Operator** | `external-secrets/` | Syncs Vault secrets into Kubernetes `Secret` resources via `ExternalSecret` CRs |
| **OpenShift Pipelines** | `openshift-pipelines/` | Tekton-based CI/CD |
| **NooBaa** | `noobaa/` | S3-compatible object storage (backing store for Quay) |
| **GitLab** | `gitlab/` | Source code management — users, groups, and repos are created via init Jobs |
| **Keycloak** | `keycloak/` | SSO/OIDC provider for Developer Hub, Trusted Artifact Signer, and OpenShift login |
| **OpenShift OAuth** | `openshift-oauth/` | Adds Keycloak as an OpenID identity provider on the cluster OAuth CR |
| **Quay** | `quay/` | Container image registry |
| **RHDH GitOps** | `gitops/` | Dedicated Argo CD instance for Developer Hub-managed applications |
| **Red Hat Developer Hub** | `redhat-developer-hub/` | Internal developer portal (Backstage) |
| **Trusted Artifact Signer** | `rhtas/` | Sigstore-based container image signing (Fulcio, Rekor, etc.) |
| **ZTunnel Healer** | `ztunnel-healer/` | CronJob that detects and restarts pods with broken Istio ambient mesh enrollment |

## App-of-apps pattern

The `app-of-apps/` chart is the root. It renders one Argo CD `Application` CR per component, each pointing back into this same repository at the appropriate chart path. Argo CD then syncs each child Application independently.

Sync waves control ordering:

- **Wave 0** — Foundational: Vault, External Secrets, OpenShift Pipelines, NooBaa
- **Wave 1** — Services: GitLab, Keycloak, Quay, RHDH GitOps
- **Wave 2** — Consumers: Red Hat Developer Hub, Trusted Artifact Signer

Every child Application uses a foreground deletion finalizer, so deleting the root app-of-apps Application cascade-deletes everything.

## Secret management

Vault is the single source of truth for secrets. The flow works like this:

1. **Ansible** provides known secrets (common password, Keycloak client secrets, ArgoCD password, etc.) as Helm values when creating the app-of-apps Application
2. **Vault's setup Job** (`vault/templates/cm-vault-setup.yaml`) initialises the KV v2 engine, configures Kubernetes auth, and **pre-populates** these known secrets at `kv/secrets/<service>/...` paths
3. **Service init Jobs** (GitLab, Quay) generate additional secrets at runtime (GitLab root PAT, webhook secret, Quay registry credentials) and write them to Vault
4. **ExternalSecret CRs** in the RHDH prereqs chart pull secrets from Vault into Kubernetes Secrets that Developer Hub consumes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Vault setup Job pre-populates secrets using values passed through Helm. In a production setup you'd use a proper secret injection workflow. Here, the tradeoff is acceptable because the passwords are generated once by Ansible and the cluster is ephemeral.

| `kv/secrets/quay/auth` | Quay config Job | — |
| `kv/secrets/quay/username` | Quay config Job | — |
| `kv/secrets/quay/password` | Quay config Job | — |
| `kv/secrets/rhdh/argocd-password` | Vault setup Job | RHDH (ExternalSecret) |
| `kv/secrets/rhdh/postgresql-password` | Vault setup Job | RHDH (ExternalSecret) |
| `kv/secrets/rhdh/kubernetes-sa-token` | RHDH SA token Job | RHDH (ExternalSecret) |
| `kv/secrets/gitlab/devspaces-oauth` | GitLab init Job | DevSpaces (ExternalSecret) |
| `kv/secrets/common/password` | Vault setup Job | — |

## Developer authentication

Workshop users (dev1, dev2, pe1, pe2) authenticate via Keycloak. The `openshift-oauth/` chart adds a **"developers"** OpenID Connect identity provider to the cluster OAuth CR alongside the default htpasswd provider. Users see both options on the OpenShift login page.

DevSpaces reuses this flow — the DevSpaces operator hardcodes `provider="openshift"` in its gateway proxy config, so it always authenticates through OpenShift OAuth, which in turn redirects to Keycloak.

## Embedded Ansible playbooks

Several charts use a pattern where a `ConfigMap` contains an Ansible playbook, and a `Job` runs it using an Ansible execution environment image. This handles multi-step imperative setup that can't be expressed declaratively:

- **`vault/templates/cm-vault-setup.yaml`** — Initialises Vault: retrieves the root token, creates policies, enables Kubernetes auth, enables the KV engine, and pre-populates secrets
- **`gitlab/templates/cm-gitlab-init.yaml`** — Waits for GitLab to be ready, creates a root PAT, configures application settings, creates users/groups/repos, imports repositories, and writes the PAT + webhook secret to Vault
- **`quay/quay-registry/templates/cm-config.yaml`** — Waits for the Quay registry to be ready, creates the admin user, extends the API token expiration, and writes registry credentials to Vault
- **`redhat-developer-hub/redhat-developer-hub-prereqs/templates/cm-sa-token-writer.yaml`** — Creates a `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` Secret, waits for the token to be populated, and writes it to Vault so RHDH can use it for cluster access
- **`redhat-developer-hub/redhat-developer-hub-config-template/templates/rhdh-config-template.yaml`** — Clones the Developer Hub config repo from GitLab, templates it with cluster-specific values, and pushes the result back

These Jobs use the `quay.io/agnosticd/ee-multicloud` execution environment image (or `ose-cli` for simpler scripts) and follow Helm/Argo CD sync-wave ordering to ensure dependencies are ready.

## ZTunnel enrollment healer

The `ztunnel-healer/` chart deploys a CronJob that detects and remediates a known issue with Istio ambient mode: on cluster restart, the ZTunnel DaemonSet can miss pod enrollment if it hasn't connected to istiod yet when the pod starts. Unenrolled pods are healthy locally but unreachable through the mesh from other nodes.

The CronJob runs every 2 minutes in a dedicated non-mesh namespace (`istio-mesh-tools`). It discovers all namespaces with `istio.io/dataplane-mode: ambient`, probes each Running pod's HBONE port (15008), and restarts any pod where the connection is refused — a definitive signal that ZTunnel never created the inbound listener. Timeouts and other probe results are treated as inconclusive and ignored.

The chart supports a `dryRun` mode that logs what would be restarted without taking action.

Other mitigations that were explored but proved insufficient on their own:
- `istio.io/use-waypoint: none` on the DB service — bypasses the L7 waypoint for PostgreSQL traffic. Removed since `appProtocol: tcp` correctly handles protocol detection and the healer addresses enrollment failures.
- `publishNotReadyAddresses: true` on the DB service — only needed if a startup probe connects to itself via service DNS.
- Init container waiting for istiod — reduces the race window but doesn't eliminate it since istiod reachability doesn't guarantee local ZTunnel enrollment.
- `istioOwnedCNIConfig: true` on the IstioCNI CR — persists CNI config across reboots but only helps newly created pods, not pods surviving a cluster restart.

## Vault auto-unseal

Vault uses Shamir key shares stored on the pod's PVC. A `CronJob` (`vault/templates/cronjob-auto-unseal.yaml`) runs every minute to check Vault's seal status and automatically unseal it if needed. This handles:

- **Initial deployment** — initialises Vault, stores unseal keys, and unseals
- **Pod/cluster restarts** — detects the sealed state and unseals using the persisted keys

## Verifying RHTAS

To verify the Trusted Artifact Signer installation:

1. Login to the OpenShift cluster

2. Download `cosign` from the OCP console "Command Line Tools" and install it in your PATH

3. `oc project trusted-artifact-signer`

4. Setup your environment:

```
export TUF_URL=$(oc get tuf -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://$(oc get route keycloak -n keycloak | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')/realms/backstage
export COSIGN_FULCIO_URL=$(oc get fulcio -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export COSIGN_REKOR_URL=$(oc get rekor -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export COSIGN_MIRROR=$TUF_URL
export COSIGN_ROOT=$TUF_URL/root.json
export COSIGN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="trusted-artifact-signer"
export COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_CERTIFICATE_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_YES="true"
export SIGSTORE_FULCIO_URL=$COSIGN_FULCIO_URL
export SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER=$COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER
export SIGSTORE_REKOR_URL=$COSIGN_REKOR_URL
export REKOR_REKOR_SERVER=$COSIGN_REKOR_URL
```

5. `cosign initialize`

6. Sign an arbitrary container image:

```
echo "FROM scratch" > ./tmp.Dockerfile
podman build . -f ./tmp.Dockerfile -t ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image:1h
podman push ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image:1h
cosign sign -y ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image:1h
```

When asked to authenticate, use one of the registered workshop users, e.g. `dev1@rhdemo.com`.

7. Verify the signature:

```
cosign verify --certificate-identity=dev1@rhdemo.com ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image:1h | jq
```

8. Show signature/security info related to the OCI artifact:

```
cosign tree ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image:1h
```
